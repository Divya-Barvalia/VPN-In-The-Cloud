<p align="center">
  A practical lab deploying a secure, free VPN server in the cloud using Amazon Web Services and OpenVPN for encrypted traffic tunneling.

<h2>🚀 Summary</h2>

<p>
  In this lab, I deployed a functional VPN server in the cloud using OpenVPN on an AWS EC2 instance. This allowed for private, secure web browsing by routing all client traffic through the VPN tunnel. The project included server setup, client connection, and testing IP anonymization via cloud infrastructure.

  Below is a high-level diagram of the cloud-based VPN infrastructure, showing how the client, VPN server, VPC, and the internet interact.

  </li>
  <li>
    Accessed the OpenVPN web admin portal at <code>https://13.59.177.129:943/admin/</code> using the credentials.<br/>

  </li>
  <li>
    Configured the server to tunnel all client traffic through the VPN (full tunnel setup).<br/>

  </li>
  <li>
    Activated the VPN and verified the connection was active by checking the public IP.<br/>

  </li>
  <li>
    Successfully confirmed that my IP matched the VPN server’s IP, proving encrypted routing was working.<br/>
